 <h1>Most Fantanstic Movies According to Haven</h1>
<h2>My personal top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>It's a whimsical take on Beauty and the Beast, but instead with wizards that could get
stuck in very beastial or monstrous forms. The maiden does save the wizard on the verge
of getting stuck in an avian stype monster shape.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<h4>The extended editions, of course</h4>
<p>It has to be the most successfull book-to-screen adapation in the history of cinema.
Tolkein's prose is so rich and the characters are so well developed. The story is so epic,
and the action is so intense. The extended editions are the best, and the movies are and
always will have a special place in my heart.</p>

<h3>Wonder Woman</h3>
<p>This is an inspiring movie based on the DC Comic of the same name. Diana is an amazing
example of hope, strength, and determination. She is a strong and capable woman who is intelligent
and compassionate. She is a role model for all women and girls. I love her and I love the movie.</p>
